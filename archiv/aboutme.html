		Outside of the scientific sphere, I more or less lead a simple life, with my beautiful wife Anneke, and our puppy Sadie.
		</p><p>
		We have been living in Ithaca, NY since Summer 2008 and have become fully acquainted with "the seasons," as non-native Californians seem to refer to the local climate. We enjoy the local waterfalls, and frequently hike trails at the nearby state parks.
		</p><p>
		Someday we may return to our native land of Southern California, but until then we busy ourselves with local friends, local food, and enjoying the unique experience that is living in Ithaca.
